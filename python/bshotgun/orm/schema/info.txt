This directory should contain a cache of the schema definitions, one per shotgun entity type.
You have control in your program where to get the schema from, and by default it will dynamically retrieve it
on first connection and attempt to cache it here.

Obviously this will only work on developer machines, but it is something you should keep in mind 
when distributing the framework - idealy it will contain a schema already as querying it from shotgun takes a long time.
