This project aims to help writing better code when interacting with shotgun, and produce working code faster and more safely.

It does this by providing an [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) to make accessing shotgun data easier. To test your code, it provides an anonymized dataset based on a real project that can be worked with offline.

Especially in Europe, Shotgun's performance leaves a lot to be desired, which is why a read-fast-write-slow shotgun connection proxy is available here.
